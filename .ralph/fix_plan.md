# Execution Pipeline: Iteration 2 - UI Refinement

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Read `./austinG.pdf` thoroughly. For each task below, refactor the existing code to match the PDF perfectly. Run a build or dev server check (`npm run build` or similar) to verify your code before marking the task complete.

- [x] **Task 1: Hero & Typography Audit**
  - Read `./austinG.pdf` Page 1. Update the Hero section to include the exact text: "Austin Legacy in Jewels" and "Designed to turn Moments into Memories".
  - Verify: Ensure the typography matches the luxury serif/sans-serif constraints and the app compiles.

- [x] **Task 2: "Latest Earring Collection" Grid Refactor**
  - Read `./austinG.pdf` Page 1. Refactor the product grid specifically for the "Latest Earring Collection".
  - Ensure the card layout clearly separates the image, the title (e.g., "Floating Heart"), the subtitle ("Your Choice of Gem"), and the price.
  - Verify: Check that the CSS Grid accurately reflects a dense, elegant catalog view and the code compiles.

- [x] **Task 3: "Sola & Luna Collection" Refactor**
  - Read `./austinG.pdf` Page 2. Refactor the "Sola & Luna Collection" section.
  - Update the specific item cards to match the text layout (e.g., "NECKLACE - Radiant Sun").
  - Verify: Ensure the spacing and padding between this section and the previous ones are generous (e.g., `py-24`).

- [x] **Task 4: Value Proposition & Footer Refactor**
  - Read the bottom of `./austinG.pdf` Page 2. 
  - Build or update the section containing: "We create long-lasting pieces that make a difference", "Sustainable and ethical", and "Handmade in small batches".
  - Verify: Code compiles and matches the deep burgundy background aesthetic.

- [x] **Task 5: Final QA and Cleanup**
  - Run `npm run build` to ensure all refactored components are strictly typed and have no dependency or layout errors.
