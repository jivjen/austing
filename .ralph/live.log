I've thoroughly analyzed the mockups and specs. Let me set up tracking and execute all 5 tasks.

## Task 1: Hero & Typography Audit

Updating the Hero heading from "Vest(a)" to "Austin Legacy in Jewels" and subtitle to "Designed to turn Moments into Memories".

## Task 2: Latest Earring Collection Grid Refactor

From the mockups, the earring collection cards need a subtitle field ("Your Choice of Gem") and a distinct "dense, elegant catalog view". I need to add subtitle support to ProductCard and create a new page section.

Now update `page.tsx` to add the "Latest Earring Collection" section with proper fallback data and restructure the page layout to match the mockups.

## Task 3: Sola & Luna Collection Card Refactor

The mockup shows each card in the Sola & Luna Collection with the category displayed as a clear uppercase label (NECKLACE, EARRINGS, BRACELET) above the product name. The current `ProductCard` already has this layout, but I need to ensure the spacing between sections is generous (`py-24`) and the card text formatting matches "NECKLACE - Radiant Sun" style. Let me verify by re-reading the card and the grid gap.

The current `ProductCard` already correctly shows:
- Category in uppercase small text (NECKLACE)
- Name in heading font (Radiant Sun)
- Price in gold (₹550)

This matches the mockup exactly. The section spacing (`py-24 md:py-32`) is already generous. Task 3 is satisfied by the current card structure and the section layout in `page.tsx`.

## Task 4: Value Proposition & Footer Refactor

Verifying the BrandStory section against mockup 2. The mockup shows:
- Deep burgundy background
- Left: "We create *long-lasting pieces* that make a difference" (italic emphasis on "long-lasting pieces")
- Below: elevator pitch paragraph
- Right top: "Sustainable and ethical" with description
- Right bottom: "Handmade in small batches" with description

The current `BrandStory.tsx` already matches this layout exactly. The Footer is minimal and correct. Both use `bg-burgundy` which maps to `#5c2a41`. Task 4 is verified.

## Task 5: Final QA - Build Check

Build succeeded with zero errors. All components compile correctly under strict TypeScript.

Now let me mark all tasks complete in `fix_plan.md`.

All 5 tasks are complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

### Changes Made

**Task 1 - Hero (`components/Hero.tsx`)**
- Heading: "Vest(a)" → "Austin Legacy in Jewels" (two-line break for elegance)
- Subtitle: → "Designed to turn Moments into Memories"
- Adjusted font sizing for the longer heading text

**Task 2 - Latest Earring Collection (`components/ProductCard.tsx` + `app/page.tsx`)**
- Added `subtitle` prop to `ProductCardProps` for the "(Your Choice of Gem)" line
- Added `imageUrl` rendering support (was declared but unused)
- Created dedicated `fallbackEarrings` data with "Floating Heart" cards at ₹499/₹699
- Separated Sanity data mapping: first 6 products → Sola & Luna, remainder → earring collection

**Task 3 - Sola & Luna Collection**
- Card layout verified: uppercase category label (NECKLACE/EARRINGS/BRACELET), heading-font product name, gold price — matches mockup exactly
- Section spacing confirmed at `py-24 md:py-32` (generous luxury whitespace)

**Task 4 - BrandStory & Footer**
- Verified both match the burgundy aesthetic from mockup 2 — no changes needed

**Task 5 - Build passes cleanly** with zero TypeScript or compilation errors.
